\usage{
slowrake(txt, stop_words = smart_words, word_min_char = 3, stem = TRUE,
  keep_pos = c("NN", "NNS", "NNP", "NNPS"))
}
\arguments{
\item{txt}{A character vector, where each element of the vector contains the
text for one document.}

\item{stop_words}{A vector of stop words which will be removed from your
documents. The default value (\code{smart_words}) contains the 'SMART' stop
words (equivalent to
\href{https://rdrr.io/rforge/tm/man/stopwords.html}{tm::stopwords('SMART')})
. A value of \code{NULL} indicates that no stop words will be removed.}

\item{word_min_char}{The minimum number of characters that a word must have
to remain in the corpus. Words with fewer than \code{word_min_char}
characters will be removed before the RAKE algorithm is applied. Also note
that filtering words based on \code{word_min_char} happens before stemming,
so you should not consider the length of a word's stem when choosing
\code{word_min_char}.}

\item{stem}{Do you want to stem the words in your documents before extracting
keywords?}

\item{keep_pos}{A vector of part-of-speech (POS) tags that specifies
acceptable parts-of-speech for keywords to have. The default value
\code{c('NN', 'NNS', 'NNP', 'NNPS')} specifies that all words that have a
POS that is noun-related (e.g., plural noun, proper noun, etc.) will be
considered when creating the list of candidate keywords. To see the other
possible POS tags along with their descriptions, see the
\code{\link{pos_tags}} data frame (\code{View(slowraker::pos_tags)}), or
see their descriptions in \href{http://martinschweinberger.de/docs/articles/PosTagR.pdf}{Part-Of-Speech Tagging with R}. Specifying \code{keep_pos = NULL} will not
filter out any words based on their POS.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{rakelist}, which is just a list of data
  frames (one data frame per document/element of \code{txt}). Each data frame
  will have the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{keyword}{A keyword that was identified by RAKE.}
    \item{freq}{The number of times the keyword appears in the document}
    \item{score}{The keyword's score, as per the RAKE algorithm. Keywords
    with higher scores are considered to be more higher quality, as compared
    to those with lower scores.}
    \item{stem}{If you specified \code{stem = TRUE}, you will also get the
    stemmed versions of the keywords in this column. When you choose stemming,
    the keyword's score (\code{score}) will be based off of its stem, but the
    reported number of times that the keyword appears (i.e., \code{freq})
    will still be based off of the raw, unstemmed version of the keyword.}
  }
}
\description{
A relatively slow version of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
algorithm. See \href{http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/22/04707498/0470749822.pdf}{Automatic keyword extraction from individual documents} for details on
how RAKE works.

\examples{
slowrake(txt = dog_pubs$title[1:5])

slowrake(txt = dog_pubs$title[1:5], stem = FALSE)

# Only consider words that are plural nouns (NNS) when creating candidate
# keywords:
slowrake(txt = c("dogs are the best, don't you think?",
                 "some people think dogs are the best, but i love my cat."),
         keep_pos = "NNS")

# ...Now only consider singular nouns:
slowrake(txt = c("dogs are the best, don't you think?",
                 "some people think dogs are the best, but i love my cat."),
         keep_pos = "NN")

# Removing "dogs" in this txt means we no longer have any candidate keywords:
slowrake(txt = "dogs are the best, don't you think?",
         stop_words = "dogs")

# Don't filter words on POS or based on membership in stop_words:
slowrake(txt = c("hi there. dogs are the best, don't you think?"),
         keep_pos = NULL, stop_words = NULL)
}
