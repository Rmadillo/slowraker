#' Slow RAKE
#'
#' A relatively slow version of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
#' algorithm. See \href{http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/22/04707498/0470749822.pdf}{Automatic keyword extraction from individual documents} for details on
#' how RAKE works.
#'
#' @param txt A character vector, where each element of the vector contains the
#'   text for one document.
#' @param stop_words A vector of stop words which will be removed from your
#'   documents. The default value (\code{smart_words}) contains the 'SMART' stop
#'   words (equivalent to
#'   \href{https://rdrr.io/rforge/tm/man/stopwords.html}{tm::stopwords('SMART')})
#'   . A value of \code{NULL} indicates that no stop words will be removed.
#' @param stop_pos Any words that have a part-of-speech (POS) that appears in
#'   \code{stop_pos} will be considered a stop word. \code{stop_pos} should be a
#'   vector of POS tags. To see all POS tags along with their definitions (i.e.,
#'   the POS that the tag denotes), see the \code{\link{pos_tags}} data frame
#'   (\code{View(slowraker::pos_tags)}). The default value is all
#'   parts-of-speech that are verbs (e.g., \code{stop_pos = c("VB", "VBD",
#'   "VBG", "VBN", "VBP", "VBZ")}). Set \code{stop_pos = NULL} if you don't want
#'   a word's POS to matter during keyword extraction.
#' @param word_min_char The minimum number of characters that a word must have
#'   to remain in the corpus. Words with fewer than \code{word_min_char}
#'   characters will be removed before the RAKE algorithm is applied. Also note
#'   that filtering words based on \code{word_min_char} happens before stemming,
#'   so you should not consider the length of a word's stem when choosing
#'   \code{word_min_char}.
#' @param stem Do you want to stem the words in your documents before extracting
#'   keywords?
#' @return An object of class \code{rakelist}, which is just a list of data
#'   frames (one data frame per document/element of \code{txt}). Each data frame
#'   will have the following columns:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{keyword}{A keyword that was identified by RAKE.}
#'     \item{freq}{The number of times the keyword appears in the document}
#'     \item{score}{The keyword's score, as per the RAKE algorithm. Keywords
#'     with higher scores are considered to be more higher quality, as compared
#'     to those with lower scores.}
#'     \item{stem}{If you specified \code{stem = TRUE}, you will also get the
#'     stemmed versions of the keywords in this column. When you choose stemming,
#'     the keyword's score (\code{score}) will be based off of its stem, but the
#'     reported number of times that the keyword appears (i.e., \code{freq})
#'     will still be based off of the raw, unstemmed version of the keyword.}
