The keyword extraction apparatus comprises technical term storage means for storing technical terms with proper expressions and different expressions thereof, and basic word storage means for storing general basic words of high frequency. Technical-term segmentation point setting means cuts out a range of any of the technical terms stored in technical term storage means from an input sentence. When the cut-out technical term is written in a different expression, the different expression is replaced by a corresponding proper expression in proper expression replacing means. Character-type segmentation point setting means detects a difference in character type in the input sentence. Basic-word segmentation point setting means cuts out, from the input sentence, a range of any of the basic words stored in the basic word storage means.

<p>There are some sections of the PDF’s text that we don’t want to run RAKE on, such as the text found in tables. The problem with these tables is that the text inside them does not contain typical phrase delimiters (e.g., periods and commas). Instead, the cell of the table acts as a sort of delimiter. However, it’s difficult to determine which parts of the PDF correspond to tables, let alone parse the cells out.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> We would therefore like to determine which sections of the text are likely to be tables, so that these sections can be removed.</p>
<p>Most of the tables in this article have numbers in them. So if we split the text into chunks using a digit delimiter, it’s likely that most of a table’s text will end up in a relatively small-sized chunk. We can then filter out these small chunks, leaving us only with the paragraphs.</p>

<a href="#filter-out-bad-keywords" class="anchor"></a>5. Filter out bad keywords</h4>
<p>The fact that some of the keywords shown above are very long suggests we missed something in Step 4. It turns out that our method mistook one of the tables for a paragraph (Table 1.1 shown below). Table 1.1 is somewhat atypical in that it doesn’t contain any numbers, and thus it makes sense that our method missed it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="table-1-1.png">
</div>
<p>To clean up the results, let’s apply an ad hoc filter on the keywords. This filter removes keywords whose long length indicates that a phrase run-on has occurred, and hence the keyword is no good.</p>
